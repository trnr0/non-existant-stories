I wish I had more to write than that I stopped believing in what I started. Obviously there were deeper and not as affectionate motives for my decision. But right now - as an mediocre writer and philospher - I can no longer write my believes as something I hold dear in my heart. 
It may sound very small from my side But I'm still not able to forgive my father for abadoning me. I'm unable to accept reality where I got a few thousand youtube views before I heard good job from my father. I  had never heard anything positive from my father's side. Not one positive memory can I share with my readers - so few there will be.
My starting theory sounds obviously very nice to inherint and take as your one. But it's not so. The requirement to take evrything that as perferct requires you to take what happends to you as perfect. And that's not a simple thing (if not impossible) to Potray.

Dear anyone whom may it concer. I do not write for the meare affection of text. I write to try to make sense of lack of my fathery refrence. It may sound a little bit misogenesitic But I do not believe a woman is able to experience the same level of indefference fromt heir father as a man is.
The main reason I can not write further is because, after much thought, I realized that writers are my enemy. Writing in ints truest sens should be a way for comunincated for annowned languge. Even If I had got that part in swizz particle transportasion mission I would propably just resign on the 2nd day. What's this shit worth for me?_
My work from this point on is merely a point of fiction in a croulening, unlpivng piece of Forvrdrodmanufactoru
